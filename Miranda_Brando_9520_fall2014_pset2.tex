Lemma 1: Let $X_i = I_S[f_i]$, then $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = I[f]$ and by chebyshev's bound therefore:

$$ Pr[ | I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] \leq \frac{ Var[X_i] }{ \epsilon^2 } $$

\begin{proof}
Let $X_i = I_S[f_i] = \frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{j=1} V(f_i, z_j)$, where $z_j$ is the random samples/data and $f_i$ is a non random (and fixed) function in $\mathcal{H}$. Then, if we take the expectation of $X_i$ wrt to the distribution of $z$ we get:
$$\mathbb{E}[X_i]  = \mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{j=1} V(f_i, z_j)] = \frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{j=1} \mathbb{E}[V(f_i, z_j)] =  \mathbb{E}[V(f_i, z_j)] = I[f_i]$$

Thus, we can use chebyshev's and thus the following statement is true (concluding proof of lemma):

$$ Pr[ | I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] \leq \frac{ Var[X_i] }{ \epsilon^2 } $$

\end{proof}

Theorem: Given the conditions in the question, the the upper bound we are looking for is as follows:

$$Pr[ \sup\limits_{f \in \mathcal{H}}  | I_s[f] - I[f] | \geq \epsilon|] \leq \frac{N(c^2-2cM+M^2)^2}{n \epsilon^2}$$
\begin{proof}

If the largest difference between the empirical risk and the expected risk is larger than $\epsilon$, then that means that the defect (i.e. difference of empirical risk and generalization error) of one of the functions in this finite set is larger than $\epsilon.$ 
i.e. At least one of the defects is larger than $\epsilon$. In equations it reads as follows:

$$Pr[ \sup\limits_{f \in \mathcal{H}}  | I_s[f] - I[f] | \geq \epsilon|] = Pr[\cup^{N}_{i=1} | I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] $$

by the union bound:

$$Pr[ \sup\limits_{f \in \mathcal{H}}  | I_s[f] - I[f] | \geq \epsilon|]  \leq \sum^{N}_{i=1} Pr[| I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] $$

By Lemma 1 we know:

$$ Pr[ | I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] \leq \frac{ Var[X_i] }{ \epsilon^2 } $$

Therefore using this upper bound we can further upper bound our equation above by:

$$ \sum^{N}_{i=1} Pr[| I_s[f_i] - I[f_i] | \geq \epsilon|] \leq \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{ Var[X_i] }{ \epsilon^2 }$$


\end{proof}
